# Keywords Generation for Product Advertisement

This is a prototype for generating an exhaustive and effective list of Search Engine Keywords. It can target any specific product, in this case Sofa, and can be useful for GoogleAds.

For this case, I have taken a retailer that offers many promotional discounts on the product. Therefore my target audience is price-sensitive cutomers.

As a final result the output generated by this code would look somewhat like this :
Campaign | Ad Group | Keword | Match
--- | --- | --- | ---
Camp.1   | Adgrp.1  | Key.1A | Exact
Camp.1   | Adgrp.1  | Key.1A | Phrase
Camp.1   | Adgrp.1  | Key.1B | Exact
Camp.1   | Adgrp.1  | Key.1b | Phrase
Camp.1   | Adgrp.2  | Key.2A | Exact
Camp.1   | Adgrp.2  | Key.2A | Phrase
